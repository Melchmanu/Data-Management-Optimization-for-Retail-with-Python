Data Management Optimization for Retail with Python

This project focuses on optimizing the data management processes for a retail store by consolidating multiple data sources, identifying errors, and providing actionable insights. The analysis supports executive decision-making by aligning data with business objectives.

Overview

Retail businesses often struggle with disparate data sources and data quality issues. This project addresses these challenges by:

    Phase 1 - Data Consolidation and Cleaning:
        Aggregating data from ERP, e-commerce exports, and a liaison table.
        Identifying and resolving errors such as mismatched keys, outliers, and missing values.

    Phase 2 - Data Analysis:
        Performing sales and stock analysis (e.g., revenue, top products, 20/80 rule, stock rotation).
        Identifying outliers in pricing using statistical methods (e.g., Z-Score, interquartile range).
        Analyzing correlations between key metrics like price, stock levels, and sales.
