## Data Pipeline
The project is divided into two main phases:

- **Phase 1: Data Consolidation and Cleaning**  
  - Aggregated data from ERP, e-commerce systems, and a liaison table to unify references.  
  - Identified data errors such as mismatches, outliers, and input mistakes.  
  - Proposed solutions to improve data quality and ensure consistency.  

- **Phase 2: Data Analysis**  
  - Performed sales analysis, including revenue by product and overall totals.  
  - Analyzed stock metrics, including turnover rate and inventory coverage.  
  - Detected pricing anomalies using boxplots and statistical methods.  
  - Evaluated correlations between quantitative metrics like price, stock, and sales.
